4. User Quiz - As a user, I want to be able to take a quiz and be “matched” with a bathroom so that I can find one that fits my mood.
Acceptance Criteria: Given that I need a bathroom and I am curious about which one is the best for me right now, when I take a quiz in the app, I will be matched with the bathroom best suited for me in regards to my answers on the quiz.
Description: Once a user logs in they can take a quiz which will be used to calculate their mood. Once a mood is calculated the app will display bathrooms which have been assigned to that mood for the user to choose from. Once again a user can filter their results(See case 3).
