3. User Search - As a user, I want to be able to track bathrooms near me, so that I can view basic information about it such as ratings, location, and mood associations. 
Acceptance Criteria: Given that I have no preference in terms of type of bathroom, I will be able to see all the bathrooms near me. If I want to know more about an individual bathroom I will be able to pull up further information about it.
Description: Given a user is logged in (refer to Case 1: New User if user must create an account) they can search for a bathroom. Bathrooms will populate on a map and users can filter through type and location and mood and then save a bathroom as a favorite so that they can come back to it later.
