1. New User - As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can use the app.
Acceptance Criteria: Given that I want to see how many public bathrooms are accessible to me, when I download the app, I should be able to make an account.
Description: In an ideal situation, the user would download the app with ease. Once the user opens the app, the first screen should present a choice for a new user to make their account with a username and password for future authentication purposes. Once the user puts in their information, their account will be ready for use instantaneously. If something goes incorrectly like a username or a password is already taken, the user should be able to change their name/password on the same page that provided the error message. (No reference story here because it is the first thing to do once this app is downloaded)
